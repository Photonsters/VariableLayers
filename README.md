# VariableLayers
Variable layer files, for testing CBD-based printers/firmwares.

It seems that CBD is finally adding some support for variables layers to the CTB file format.
[uv3dp](https://github.com/ezrec/uv3dp) has an early implementation for reading/writing these files.  Here you can find test files
that started as UVJ (created with a python script), then converted to CTB V3 with uv3dp.
